This thesis addresses the challenge of building interpretable and efficient
machine learning systems for 3D scene understanding in safety-critical domains,
with a particular focus on power grid inspection. While deep learning has
achieved strong results in 3D perception tasks, most models operate as black
boxes, lack geometric structure, and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their applicability in real-world infrastructure
monitoring.

We investigate geometric inductive biases (GIBs) as a main approach to
introduce structure, interpretability, and efficiency into 3D learning
pipelines. Our contributions include: (i) SCENE-Net, a white-box model based on
Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs); (ii) SCENE-Net v2, a
grey-box extension using GIBs as feature extractors; (iii) GIBLi, a modular
GIB-layer for raw point clouds designed for integration with modern deep
networks; and (iv) TS40K, a domain-specific benchmark for rural power grid
inspection. In parallel, we propose a cost-aware decision support system that
leverages these components within human-in-the-loop workflows for inspection
automation.

Together, these contributions establish a unified framework for interpretable
geometric reasoning in 3D vision. Our goal is to bridge the gap between
structured inductive biases and high-performance black-box models, enabling
robust, transparent, and operationally viable machine learning tools for
large-scale inspection scenarios.
